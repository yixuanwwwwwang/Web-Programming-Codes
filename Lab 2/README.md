The purpose of this lab is to familiarize yourself with Node.js modules and further your understanding of JavaScript syntax.

In addition, you must have error checking for the arguments of all your functions. If an argument fails error checking, you should throw a string describing which argument was wrong, and what went wrong. You can read more about error handling on the MDN (Links to an external site.).

Testing
In your index.js file, you must import all the modules you created above and create one passing and one failing test case for each function in each module. So you will have a total of 24 function calls (there are 12 total functions)
