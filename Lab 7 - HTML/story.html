            <h2>The story that I was in an interview</h2>
            <p>It was a sunny day. I went to the company to have an interview. The job that I applied for is a Data Scientist. </p>
            <p>The requirements of the role were very strict. The candidates had to know knowledge of Python, R, SQL, Java, C++, JavaScript, etc. </p>
            <p>I introduced myself at first. I went through my resume and talked about my personality and the fields that I'm interested in. Then the interviewer gave me a code test. It was difficult but I finished it well. I was happy. The recruiter was very happy too. After a thirty minutes, we ended the interview. Then I was asked to go home and to wait for them to make a decision.</p>
            <p>After two days, I received an email. The email was from that company. It was an offer. The salary is very high. I'm so excited. I'm proud of myself!</p>
