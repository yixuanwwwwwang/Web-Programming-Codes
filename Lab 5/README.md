# JSON Routes
 - For this lab, you will create a simple server that will provide data from an API.

 - For this lab, you will not need to use a database. 

 - For this lab, you must use the async/await keywords (not Promises). You will also be using axios (Links to an external site.), which is a HTTP client for Node.js; you can install it with npm i axios. You will use it just as you did in lab 3 except the URL you pass to axios will be different than lab 3's


# TV Maze API

 - For this lab, you will be using two endpoints of the TV Maze API which is an API about TV shows  for your Axios calls.  The list of shows:  http://api.tvmaze.com/shows (Links to an external site.) and then you'll get an individual show using the endpoint http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/:id (Links to an external site.) where :id is the ID of the show you are looking up.

 - You will use these two endpoints to make your axios.get calls depending on which route is called.
