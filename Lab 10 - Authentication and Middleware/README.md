Authentication and Middleware
For this lab, we will creating a basic server with user login, based on a static JSON file with usernames and hashed passwords. In addition, we will be creating a very basic logging middleware.

We will be using two new npm packages for this lab:

bcrypt (Links to an external site.): a password hasing library. If you have problems installing that modules (since it uses C++ bindings), you can also try bcrypt.js (Links to an external site.), which has the same API but is written in 100% JS.
express-session (Links to an external site.): a simple session middleware for Express.
