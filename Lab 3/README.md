The purpose of this lab is to familiarize yourself with asynchronous programming in JavaScript, as well as using modules from the Node.js Package Manager (npm (Links to an external site.)).

For this lab, you must use the async/await keywords (not Promises). You will also be using axios (Links to an external site.), which is a HTTP client for Node.js; you can install it with npm i axios.

In addition, you must have error checking for the arguments of all your functions. If an argument fails error checking, you should throw a string describing which argument was wrong, and what went wrong.

You will be creating three .js files: people.js, work.js and app.js.
