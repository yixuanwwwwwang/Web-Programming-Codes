For this lab, we are going to make a few parts of a movie database. You will create the first of these data modules, the module to handle a listing of movies.

You will:

Separate concerns into different modules.
Store the database connection in one module.
Define and store the database collections in another module.
Define your Data manipulation functions in another module. 
Continue practicing the usage of async / await for asynchronous code
Continuing our exercises of linking these modules together as needed
Packages you will use:
You will use the mongodb (Links to an external site.) package to hook into MongoDB

You may use the lecture 4 code (Links to an external site.) as a guide.

You must save all dependencies you use to your package.json file
